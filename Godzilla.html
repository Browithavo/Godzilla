    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla" id="linkpoop">Godzilla</a> (Japanese: ゴジラ, Hepburn: Gojira,
        /ɡɒdˈzɪlə/;
        [ɡoꜜdʑiɾa] is a fictional
        monster, or kaiju, originating from a series of Japanese films. The character first appeared in the 1954 film
        Godzilla and became a worldwide pop culture icon, appearing in various media, including 32 films produced by
        Toho, four Hollywood films and numerous video games, novels, comic books and television shows. Godzilla has been
        dubbed the "King of the Monsters", a phrase first used in Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), the
        Americanized version of the original film.</p>
    <p>Gojira (ゴジラ) is a portmanteau of the Japanese words: gorira (ゴリラ, "gorilla") and kujira (鯨クジラ, "whale"), owing to
        the fact that in one planning stage, Godzilla was described as "a cross between a gorilla and a whale", due to
        its size, power and aquatic origin</p>
    <p>Godzilla's signature weapon is its "atomic heat beam" (also known as "atomic breath"), nuclear energy that it
        generates inside of its body, uses electromagnetic force to concentrate it into a laser-like high velocity
        projectile and unleashes from its jaws in the form of a blue or red radioactive beam.</p>
    <p>Godzilla is amphibious: it has a preference for traversing Earth's hydrosphere when in hibernation or migration,
        can breathe underwater and is described in the original film by the character Dr. Yamane as a transitional
        form between a marine and a terrestrial reptile. Godzilla is shown to have great vitality: it is immune to
        conventional weaponry thanks to its rugged hide and ability to regenerate, and as a result of surviving a
        nuclear explosion, it cannot be destroyed by anything less powerful. It has an electromagnetic pulse-producing
        organ in its body which generates an asymmetrical permeable shield making it impervious to all damage except for
        a short period when the organ recycles.
    </p>
    <p>Godzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of Japanese popular culture worldwide, and remains an
        important facet of Japanese films, embodying the kaiju subset of the tokusatsu genre. Godzilla's vaguely
        humanoid appearance and strained, lumbering movements endeared it to Japanese audiences, who could relate to
        Godzilla as a sympathetic character, despite its wrathful nature. Audiences respond positively to the
        character because it acts out of rage and self-preservation and shows where science and technology can go wrong.
